1. Introduction
  The problem of having a very large amount of active users being followed affects heavily active social media users;
  the impact of which is forgetting or missing important information or updates about some of those users. For social media
  users who struggle to remember information about the many people they follow, BVOC is a Social Media App that organizes and
  allows users to heavily customize the information they see and are updated about, providing automatic updates of user chosen
  information, and superior organization.Our value proposition is that BVOC provides an easier, more automated and more 
  organized social media platform to users with large amounts of followers or that desire a superior form of organization 
  through user customized group settings for the main update feed.

2. Implemented Requirements
  These are the user stories we have implemented from our Trello:
    "As a user, I want a customizable profile so that I can have that data that I want to share be stored for others to view."
    "As a user, I want to have a specific profile code so that I add the correct users."
  The use cases we used were as follows:
    A user being able to update their profile
    A user messaging a single person
    A user being able to view other profileâ€™s information.

3. Adopted Technologies
  Java
    We are using Java as our main programming language because we feel the most comfortable with it and feel it is useful 
    for our product requirements.
  Java Servlet
    We are using a Java Servlet for our server so we do not need to buy and configure a web server for the first release of
    our product. We also keep our database within this piece of software so it is easily accessible over the whole server.
  Docker
    We are using Docker to deploy our product because it is one of the requirements for our assignment.
  XML
    We use XML to produce the front-end interface for our product.
  Android Studio 
    We are using Android Studio to produce a visual representation of our desired app as we code.

4. Learning/Training
To be able to learn the technologies we were new to, we researched them and watched educational videos on how they are used
and how to implement them. If we were confused by something we asked each other for help and/or research some more.

5. Deployment

6. Licensing
We chose to use the MIT License because it is simple and easy and allows other developers to improve and use our code if
they would like, which is something as a team we are all okay with.
